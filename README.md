# SelfInjector - Traditional Version

This repository accompanies the article **From traditional to templated malware**. It is a minimal example of a shellcode self-injector, which is offered as both a traditional static version (which you can find on the *traditional* branch) or a version templated with [Blueprint](https://github.com/Hackcraft-Labs/Blueprint) (which can be found on the *templated* branch).
